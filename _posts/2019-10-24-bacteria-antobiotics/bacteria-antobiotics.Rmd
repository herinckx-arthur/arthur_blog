This post is an analysis of Analysis of: [Pretty as a peacock : The gemstone for the next generation of smart sensors](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/news/pretty-peacock-gemstone-next-generation-smart-sensors) . 


## Summary 
Scientific of all around the world and led by the universities of surrey worked together to create a new photonic crystal associate with a tiny quantity of graphene, witch thought beautiful could be useful for a wide range of application due to is property.

In fact, this material can react to a vast range of stimuli like: temperature, pression, organic life and chemicals associate and also keep in memory the form of a surface.

For all of this reasons, they think this material could be an exceptional indicator of physicals and chemicals changes.

| General topic                | The creation of a new photonic crystal based on the addition of graphene                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Procedure/ what was examined | The took their inspiration on the vast range of colour on the tail of peacocks and beetle shells, witch come from the molecular structure and not pigmentation                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Conclusion/ discovery        | The new crystal can : indicate if they were expose to a rise of temperature (useful for perishable food), keep the shape in memory and react when expose to pressure, interact with virus and serve like a bioindicator, be use like a body sensors for sportive activity or hand-washing indicator and all of that for a relatively low cost. |
