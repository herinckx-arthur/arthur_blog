title: " A new super-hydrophobic material inspire of butterfly wings"
description: |
  The fly of insects are sometimes chaotic but most of the time there is something gracious in their ability to fly, even if it rains cats and dogs. For this particular reason, scientist have studied the molecular structure of butterfly wings.

| General topic                   | The ability of butterfly wings to deflect heavy rain                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Procedure ? What was examined ? | They put different material like leaf, feather or insects and film the impact with high-speed camera of water-drops on their surfaces                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Discovery / remaining question  | They discovered that butterfly wings are covered of nano-metric layer of wax and microscopic bump. The combination of these two characteristics give to the surface of the wings a super-hydrophobic capability that protect butterfly from rain and hypothermia. This capability may be applicable on spay for shoes or clothes for giving  waterproof propriety or on wings plane to increase their aerodynamic. |
