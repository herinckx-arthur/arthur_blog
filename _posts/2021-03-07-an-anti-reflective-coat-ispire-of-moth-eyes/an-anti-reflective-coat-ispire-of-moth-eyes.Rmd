| General topic                    | How and what are the applications for a bio anti reflective material inspire of moth eyes                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Procedure ?  What was examined   | They recreated the graded pattern of moth eyes and found a new production technique which is cheaper and more adapted to an industrial production ( inductively coupled plasma).                                                                          |
|  Discovery / Remaining questions | The production of this new material was a success, an improvement of the visibility of flat screen display like cellphone or computer are expected. Also, an improvement of solar panel productivity could be made due to the capability of the material. |
