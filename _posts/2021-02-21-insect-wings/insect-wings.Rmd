| Published in ? When ?           | August 18, 2020 in nature reviews microbiology                                                                                                                                     |
| General topic                   | How micro-structure place on dragonflies and cicadas can have antibacterials effects and how we could use these structures to overcome our the increasing of super bugs infections |
| Procedure ?  What was examined  | they recreated these structures artificially and monitored their effectiveness on different type of bacteria                                                                       |
| Discovery / Remaining questions | they discovered than some structure are more effective on specific type of bacteria but they struggle to understand the mechanism which provoke the lysis of bacteria              |
