| General topic                | The creation of a new photonic crystal based on the addition of graphene                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Procedure/ what was examined | The took their inspiration on the vast range of colour on the tail of peacocks and beetle shells, witch come from the molecular structure and not pigmentation                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Conclusion/ discovery        | The new crystal can : indicate if they were expose to a rise of temperature (useful for perishable food), keep the shape in memory and react when expose to pressure, interact with virus and serve like a bioindicator, be use like a body sensors for sportive activity or hand-washing indicator and all of that for a relatively low cost. |
| Remaining question           | /                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
