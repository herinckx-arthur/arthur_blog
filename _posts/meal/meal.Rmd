Today I read an article in the BBC news which speak about the medialized U.S election. Finally Donald Trumps admit the obvious fact that he lost the election In his favorite social media ... Twitter. This news make me happy and I thought " great now he can move out and let Joe biden do the job he have to do", But of course even if it's the first time he recognizes his defeat, his ego can not accept that he lost the election in a fair way and bawl that the election was ridged even if there is nothing to confirm his comments. 

Another thing is that I begin a new series, " Peaky blinder". For what I saw, it is great, well scripted and there is a notable industrial revolution ambiance. I hope it will continue in the two other saisons.
