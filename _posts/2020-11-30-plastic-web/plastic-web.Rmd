title: "a new plastic material inspire of spider web"
description: |
  spider webs are know for their extreme resistance but what could be have if we combine their structures with plastic ? The answer, a new material which is as much durable as plastic and as much resistant as spider web.

| General topic ?                 | The creation of a material which combine both propriety of poly-carbonate and spider web.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Procedure / What was examined ? | They use 3-d printer to create a thin mesh of poly-carbonate where every layer is perpendicular to the previous one. And also, as the flux of poly-carbonate is very slow, when the poly-carbonate cool, it have a tendency to form a succession of loop which provide the resistance. The overall structure can be compare to a chain-mail.                           |
| Conclusion/ discovery ?         | The new material can absorb 93% of the energy of impacts without breaking due to sacrificial link which break when impacts occurred, thus the overall structure are preserve .This discovery could be the opening for a new generation of  bullet-proof glass or protective smartphone screen or other application which have for vocation protection and resistance.   |
