title: "The unbreakable shell of iron beetles."
description: |
  Beetles are know for the hardness of their shell and how difficult it is to break them even for us as human. But one of them outclass all, iron beetle. For this reason, scientist lead a study to understand the resistance of their shell.

| Procedure / what was examined ? | they examined the structure of the shell and how the connection between elytres is made                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Conclusion / Discovery ?        | they found that there are lateral support structure which increase the stiffness in some place of the shell and help in the distribution of weight in case of choc. Also, the jigsaw design and the increase of number of connections between elytres rise the global resistance. This discovery as been tested on a 3D printed model, and the results show that the joint of the model are more tough than common engineering joint.  For this reason, maybe in the future engineers will mimic the biological structure of iron beetles elytres  to create new impact-resistance structures. |
